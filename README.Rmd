# inserttable

`inserttable` is an RStudio add-in facilitating insertion of nicely formatted
tables in R markdown documents or plain R scripts.

## Installation

You can install `inserttable` from [GitHub](https://github.com/lbusett/insert_table)
with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("lbusett/insert_table")
```

## Usage

Upon installing, `inserttable` registers a new RStudio Addin (__Insert Table__)
that can be used to easily insert a table in a `Rmd` document. To use it, open a 
`Rmd` or `R` document and select  "Addins --> Insert Table". 

There are two main __use modes__:


### Launch the addin with the cursor on a empty line

In this case, a GUI will open allowing you to __select the desired output format__ (
`kable`, `kableExtra`, `DT` and `rhandsontable` are currently implemented), and to __edit the 
content of the table__. After clicking __Done__ the Addin will add in the file 
the code needed to generate the table in a nice `tribble` format (thanks 
to Miles McBain's [`datapasta`](https://github.com/milesmcbain/datapasta) package!) 
to allow easier additional editing, and also the code needed to render it with the selected 
output format using some default options, as can be seen below: 
 
__IMPORTANT NOTE:__ Not all output formats play well with knitting to PDF or Word!. 
`kable` works everywhere, while `DT` and `rhandsontable` work out of the box only
if knitting to html. You can make them work on PDF and Word by adding
`always_allow_html: yes` in the yaml header of the Rmd, and installing __phantomjs__ using:
`webshot::install_phantomjs()` (results are not that good, though).

A useful feature is that, for larger tables, you can also __cut and paste content from a spreadsheet__ :

Obviously, rendering of the table can be tweaked further by changing/adding arguments of the rendering functions in the automatically generated code.


### Launch the addin while selecting the name of a variable

In this case, the GUI allows you to select __only the desired output format__ (
it is assumed that the variable you select corresponds to a `data frame` or similar
object containing the data you wish to show as table). After clicking __Done__
the Addin will add in the `Rmd` document the code needed to render the selected variable as a table with the selected output format. The code will be added at the first empty line below that containing the name of the selected variable.

__IMPORTANT NOTE__: `inserttable` will make no effort to guarantee that the 
variable you select is a `data.frame`. It is up to you to select a meaningful
variable!


## Usage from the console

You can also use (part of) `inserttable` functionality from the console by calling
function `insert_table()`. 

```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
> insert_table(tbl_name = "table_1", nrows = 4, ncols = 4, tbl_format = "DT")

```

The function will return __to the console__ the code needed tos create a empty 
table of the specified dimensions and render it with the selected format:
