# inserttable

`inserttable` is an RStudio add-in facilitating insertion of nicely formatted
tables in R markdown documents.

## Installation

You can install `inserttable` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("lbusett/insert_table")
```

## Usage

Upon installing, `inserttable` will register a new RStudio Addin that can be
used to easily insert a table in a `Rmd` document. To use it, open a R markdown
document and, with the cursor in a `r` chunk, select "Addins --> INSERTTABBLE --> 
Insert Table". There are two use cases: 

### Launch the addin with the cursor on a empty line

In this case, a GUI will open allowing you to __select the desired output format__ (
`kable`, `DT` and `rhandsontable` are currently implemented), and to __edit the content
of the table__. After clicking __Done__ the Addin will add the code needed
to generate the table (in `tribble` format to allow easier editing, thanks to 
[`datapasta`](https://github.com/milesmcbain/datapasta!) and to render it with the 
selected output format in the `Rmd` document using some default options:

For larger tables, you can also __cut and paste content from a spreadsheet__ :

Rendering of the table can successively be tweaked further by changing the arguments
of the rendering functions.


### Launch the addin while selecting the name of a variable

In this case, the GUI allows you to select __only the desired output format__ (
`kable`, `DT` and `rhandsontable` are currently implemented). After clicking __Done__
the Addin will add in the `Rmd` document the code needed to render the selected variable
as a table with the selected output format. The code will be added at the first 
empty line below that containing the name of the selected variable.

__IMPORTANT NOTE__: `inserttable` will make no effort to guarantee that the 
variable you select is a `data.frame`. It is up to you to select a meaningful
variable!

## Usage from the console

You can also use (part of) `inserttable` functionality from the console by calling
function `insert_table()`. 

```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}

> insert_table(tbl_name = "table_1", nrows = 4, ncols = 4, tbl_format = "DT")

```

The function will return __to the console__ the code needed to create a empty 
table of the specified dimensions and render it with the selected format:
